Shortcode for placing adsense ads within pages and posts.

== Description ==

Shortcode for placing adsense ads within pages and posts.

Comes with 6 built in ad types that can each use a different adsense ad slot id.

**Types:**

Square (square)

Above Fold Square (msquare)

Banner (banner)

Vertical Links (vlink)

Horizontal Links (hlink)

Mobile Banner (mbanner)

Large Mobile Banner (lmbanner)


Tries to fit in with responsive layouts. I'd like to know of any issues there.
The above fold square type changes into a 320x50 ad on mobile screens

In the post editor there is a new "Carrot" button in the visual editor as well as split out buttons in the code editor.

While logged into Adsense, click your email in the top right to reveal your Publisher ID.

In Adsense, click "My Ads" > "New Ad Unit". Create an add for the desired type.
Back on the "My Ads" screen, you will see your ad and copy the text under the "ID" column.

= I've done all you asked and added ads to a page and they aren't showing? =

Ensure your Publisher ID is correct. Ensure Ad IDs are correct. Ensure you inserted your shortcodes into your post or page.
Ensure your site is allowed to display ads (in adsense settings). If your ad IDs are new, wait at least an hour and refresh the page.
